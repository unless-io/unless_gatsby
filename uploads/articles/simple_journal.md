I've found that it's easier to create a routine or a habit out of anything if you keep a log of what you did and when. Maybe write a little bit about the experience, save a picture.

Simple Journal was born from that idea. Keep a journal, every day. Want to do something more often? Keeping track of it is the first step.

The main concept behind Simple Journal is keeping a streak. Log something every day. Doesn't matter what, just keep at it.
Want to reinforce a habit? Like painting, for example? Save it as an activity on the platform, and start logging.
Then review your progress over time in charts and calendars.

Simple Journal was designed and developed in full by Unless, using Ruby on Rails.
