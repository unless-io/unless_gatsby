Bit is a research and prototyping studio based in Amsterdam and Delft, run by 50 young talents. For this project we worked together with a team of in-house designers and freelancers to set up several iterations of landing pages. We provided mainly on the software development side on the website, but also participated in the UX design. The first iteration of the website was set up using Ruby/Middleman, the final iteration was created using React/Gatsby.
